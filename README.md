This repository contains an example ROS package that showcases basic ROS functionalities including subscribing and publishing messages. The primary purpose of this package is to serve as a template that I use for quickly setting up new ROS packages/nodes, mainly because it saves time and effort when starting new projects..

## Overview

The node in this package subscribes to `input_topic`, processes incoming messages by adding a fixed number to them, and publishes the result to `output_topic`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a compatible version of ROS installed, preferably ROS Noetic, as this package was developed with that version.
